JavaScript 1  

1.  Name the three ways to declare a variable? 
	var, let, const.
2.  Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why? 
	const, bc it can't be reassigned; doing so willl cause an error.
3.  What rules should you follow when naming variables? 
	concice, obvious and descriptive naming, the name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _
	with the first character not being a digit, not use reserved words, use camelCase.
4.  What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings? 
	it will concatenate the numbers to the string
5.  How does the % operator work? 
	retuns the reminder of the division of the operands
6.  Explain the difference between == and ===. 
	operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator ==
	while operator === checks the equality without type conversion.
7.  When would you receive a NaN result?
	NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined
	mathematical operation 
8.  How do you increment and decrement a number? 
	++ --
9.  Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators. 
	when placed before it will retunr he incremented/decremented value, when placed after it,
	will return the original value then increments/decrements the operand
10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS? 
	Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
	As in traditional mathematics, multiplication is done first.
	When using parentheses, operations inside the parentheses are computed first
	Operations with the same precedence (like * and /) are computed from left to right
11. How do you log information to the console?
	console.log() 
12. What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers? 
	it joins them
13. What are the eight data types in JavaScript? 
	numbers, booleans, strings, symbols, bigint, objects, functions, undefined
14. Which data type is NOT primitive? 
	object
15. What is the relationship between null and undefined? 
	null= empty, undefined= doesn't exist so equal but not identical
16. What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings? 
	For single and duble quotes, using one to wrap the string with, will allow the use of the other a part pf the string
	backticks allow embedding values of variables in the displey of a string
17. What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string? 
	extended functionality quotes
18. Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string? 
	 ${}
19. How do you embed variables/expressions in a string? 
	`${}`
20. How do you escape characters in a string? 
	with backslash
21. What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods? 
	slice() extracts parts of a string and returns the extracted parts in a new string. 
	substr() extracts parts of a string, beginning at the character at the specified position, 
	and returns the specified number of characters. substring() extracts parts of a string 
	and returns the extracted parts in a new string.
22. What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for? 
	|| or true- if one operand is true, && and true if both operands are true,
	! not changes true to fals and fals to true
23. What are the comparison operators? 
	>,<, >=, <=, ==,!=, ===, !==
24. What are truthy and falsy values? 
	these are the values that evaluateted in boolean contex are true or fals
25. What are the falsy values in JavaScript? 
	0, undefined, null, nan, empty string, fals
26. What are conditionals? 
	are blocks of code that execute only if the condition expresion/s evaluate to true.
27. What is the syntax for an if/else conditional? 
	if (condition) {
	block of code
	} else {
	}
28. What is the syntax for a switch statement? 
	switch(expression) {
	  case x:
	    code block
 	   break;
	  case y:
	    code block
	    break;
	  default:
	    code block
	}
29. What is the syntax for a ternary operator? 
	condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
30. What is nesting? 
	writing something inside something
31. What are functions useful for? 
	reusing code
32. How do you invoke a function? 
	functionName();
33. What are anonymous functions? 
	a function without a name that returns a function object and  so is useful to assign it to a varable
34. What is function scope? 
	variables created in a function can not be accesed from outside that function
35. What are return values? 
	the values that a function retuns when it completes
36. What are arrow functions? 
	a compact alternative to a traditional function expression
